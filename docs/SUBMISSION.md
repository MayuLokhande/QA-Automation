## What Happens Next?

### Timeline
- **Day 0-2**: We review your submission
- **Day 3**: We send feedback or interview invitation
- **Day 4-7**: Technical interview scheduled (if selected)

### Review Process
We'll evaluate:
1. Functional correctness (do tests work?)
2. Code quality (is it maintainable?)
3. Business understanding (do you test the right things?)
4. Problem-solving (how do you handle edge cases?)

### Interview Preparation
If selected for interview, you'll:
- Walk through your solution (15 mins)
- Discuss design decisions (15 mins)
- Live coding exercise (20 mins)
- Q&A session (10 mins)

## Common Issues to Avoid

### ❌ Submission Failures
- Repository is public (must be private)
- Tests don't run on reviewer's machine
- Missing SOLUTION.md file
- Credentials hardcoded in code

### ⚠️ Quality Issues
- Tests are flaky (pass sometimes, fail others)
- No cleanup causing test pollution
- Poor error messages when tests fail
- Over-complicated solutions

### ✅ Best Practices
- Clear test names describing business scenario
- Consistent code style
- Helpful error messages
- Clean Git history

## Need Help?

### Technical Issues
If you encounter technical problems:
- Create an issue in your fork
- Email us with specific error messages
- Include screenshots if relevant

### Time Extensions
If you need more time:
- Email us before the deadline
- Explain the reason
- We typically grant 2-3 day extensions

### Platform Access
If you can't access the music school platforms:
- Try alternative platforms listed
- Contact us for backup options
- We can provide test account if needed

## Final Tips

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Better to have 5 excellent tests than 15 mediocre ones
2. **Document Assumptions**: If something is unclear, document your assumption and proceed
3. **Show Your Thinking**: Comments and documentation help us understand your approach
4. **Be Honest**: In SOLUTION.md, be honest about challenges and time spent
5. **Ask Questions**: If stuck, it's better to ask than to guess

Good luck! We're excited to see your solution and learn about your testing approach.
